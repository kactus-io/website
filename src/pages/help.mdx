# Documentation

Kactus is built on top of the giant called [`git`](https://git-scm.com). That's why in order to use Kactus efficiently, we will need to learn some concepts used by `git`. While it is a very powerful technology and as such can be overwhelming at first, we just need a few key concepts to start with.

Here is a quick [glossary](/help/glossary) of specific terms that we use across the documentation.

## How does it work?

That's a good question. In a seemigly magical fashion, Kactus transforms your sketch files into separate text files. One for each layer. This allows `git` to track them, merge them, compare them.

Read more about [how to work with Kactus](/help/how-to).

## Configuration

You can do a lot of things with Kactus: share one or multiple pages across your sketch files, share the text styles, etc..

All this configuration is done via a file called `kactus.json`. See what its format is [here](/help/kactus-dot-json).
