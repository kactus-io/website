        These Kactus Terms and Conditions ("Application Terms") are a legal
        agreement between you (either as an individual or on behalf of an
        entity) and Mathieu Dutour, doing business as Kactus.io, regarding your
        use of Kactus and associated documentation ("Software"). These
        Application Terms apply to the executable code version of the Software.
        Source code for the Software is available separately and free of charge
        under open source software license agreements. If you do not agree to
        all of the terms in these Application Terms, do not download, install,
        use, or copy the Software.
      </p>

      <h2>Connecting to GitHub</h2>

      <p>
        If you configure the Software to work with one or more accounts on the
        GitHub.com website or with an instance of GitHub Enterprise, your use of
        the Software will also be governed your applicable GitHub.com website
        Terms of Service and/or the license agreement applicable to your
        instance of GitHub Enterprise ("GitHub Terms").
      </p>

      <p>
        Any use of the Software that violates your applicable GitHub Terms will
        also be a violation of these Application Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Open Source Licenses and Notices</h2>

      <p>
        The open source license for the Software is included in the "Open Source
        Notices" documentation that is included with the Software. That
        documentation also includes copies of all applicable open source
        licenses.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to open source
        components require Kactus to make an offer to provide source code in
        connection with the Software, such offer is hereby made, and you may
        exercise it by contacting Kactus:
        <a href="http://kactus.io/contact">http://kactus.io/contact</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unless otherwise agreed to in writing with Kactus, your agreement with
        Kactus will always include, at a minimum, these Application Terms. Open
        source software licenses for the Software's source code constitute
        separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source
        software licenses expressly supersede these Application Terms, the open
        source licenses govern your agreement with Kactus for the use of the
        Software or specific included components of the Software.
      </p>
